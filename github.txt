                            CLONING
============================================================
So far we've created our own Git repositories from scratch, but often we want to get a local copy of an existing repository instead.

To do this, we can clone a remote repository hosted on Github or similar websites. All we need is a URL that we can tell Git to close for use.

To clone the repo, simply run git clone <url>

git clone <url>  -> Git will retrive all the files associated with the repository and will copy them to our local machine.

In addition, Git initializes a new repository on our machine, giving us access to the full Git history of the cloned project.

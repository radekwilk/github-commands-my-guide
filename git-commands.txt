GIT COMMANDS
==================================================================

1. git status  -> it will show status in our current repository

2. git init    -> this will initiate a new repository. This is something we do once per project. Initialize the repo in the top-level folder containing our project.

3. git add file1 file2 file3   -> it adds specific files to the stagng area. We can separate files with spaces to add multiple files at once.

4. git add .  -> this adds to stage all changes at once

5. git commit  -> we use this command to actually commit changes from the staging area. When making a commit, we need to provide a commit message that summarizes the changes and work snapshotted in the commit

6. git commit -m 'This is a message we provide during commit'  -> this is a way of commiting the changes

7. git log  -> it just print info about all commits

8. IF WE DO MISTAKE AND do git commit, we can end up in default VIM editior. 
     - to type anything, click letter I to get -INSERT- mode (I for insert)
     - to get out of it, click esc first, to get out of -INSERT- mode
     - then we have to enter this three buttons  :wq    (w-write, q-quit)

9. If we want to add longer commnt messages, we need to configure git to open our editor of choice
   For examplem, this command is for VS Code:
   git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

10. git log --oneline  -> it will display all commints in more readable format

11. Amending Commits - if we just made a commit and then realized thet we forgot to include a file! Or, maybe we made a typo in the commit message that we want to correct. Rather than making a brand new separate commit, we can "redo" the previous commit using the --amend option

12. Ignoring files  -> use of .gitignore  
    Inside repository, we create a file called .gitignore. Inside the file, we can write patterns to tell Git which files and folders to igonre:
    - ignoreThisFile.doc => it will ignore this specific file name;
    - folderName/ => will ignore an entire directory
    - *.log will ignore any files with .log extension

    To generate .gitignore file for specific language/framework we work with, use this link:
    gitignore.io

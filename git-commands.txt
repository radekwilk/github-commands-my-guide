1. git status  -> it will show status in our current repository

2. git init    -> this will initiate a new repository. This is something we do once per project. Initialize the repo in the top-level folder containing our project.

3. git add file1 file2 file3   -> it adds specific files to the stagng area. We can separate files with spaces to add multiple files at once.

4. git commit  -> we use this command to actually commit changes from the staging area. When making a commit, we need to provide a commit message that summarizes the changes and work snapshotted in the commit

5. git commit -m 'This is a message we provide during commit'  -> this is a way of commiting the changes

6. git log  -> it just print info about all commits

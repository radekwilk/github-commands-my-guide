                    CONTEXT
===================================================

On large projects, we often work in multiple contexts:
    1. We're working on 2 different color scheme variations for our website at the same time, unsure of which we like best.

    2. We're also trying to fix a horrible bug, but it's proving tough to solve. We need to really hunt around and toggle some code on and off to figure it out.

    3. A teammate is also working on adding a new chat widget to present at the next meeting. It's unclear if our company will be using it.

    4. Another coworker is updating the search bar autocomplete.

    5. Another developer is doing an experimental radical design overhaul of the entire layout to present next month.

                    BRANCHES 
=========================================================

Branches are alternative timelines for a project.

They enable us to create separate context where we can try new things, or even work on multiple ideas in parallel

I we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the other branches (unless we merge the changes)
